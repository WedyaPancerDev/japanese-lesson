<h2  id="part1">Unintended Actions</h2>
This is the first of many useful tools that will become essential in your day-to-day conversations.  We will now learn how to express an
action that has taken place unintentionally often with unsatisfactory results.  This is primarily done by the verb 「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」.  Let's look at an example.
<p><span title="こうすけ - Kousuke" class="popup">康介</span>：　<span title="しゅくだい - homework" class="popup">宿題</span>を<span title="やる - to do" class="popup">やった</span>？- Did you do homework?
<br />アリス：　<em><span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまった</span></em>！- Oh no! (I screwed up!)
</p>

<h2 id="part2">Using 「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 with other verbs</h2>
When 「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 is used in this sense, it is normal to attach it to the <a href="compound.html#part2">te-form</a> of another verb to express an action that is done or
happened unintentionally.  As is common with this type of grammar, the tense is decided by the tense of  「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」.

<p>（１）　<span title="その - that" class="popup">その</span><span title="ケーキ - cake" class="popup">ケーキ</span>を<span title="ぜんぶ - all" class="popup">全部</span><em><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べて</span></em><span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまった</span>。- Oops, I ate that whole cake.
<br />（２）　<span title="まいにち - every day" class="popup">毎日</span><span title="ケーキ - cake" class="popup">ケーキ</span>を<span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べて</span>、<span title="にキロ - 2 kilograms" class="popup">２キロ</span><em><span title="ふとる - to get fat" class="popup">太って</span></em><span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまいました</span>。- I ate cake everyday and I (unintentionally) gained two kilograms.
<br />（３）　<span title="ちゃんと - properly" class="popup">ちゃんと</span><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べない</span>と、<em><span title="やせる - to get skinny" class="popup">痩せて</span></em><span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまいます</span>よ。- If you don't eat properly, you'll (unintentionally) lost weight you know.

<p>If you want to see many more examples, look up 「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 on WWWJDIC and click the [EX] link.  There are over 100 examples with translations for you
to enjoy.</p>

<h2 id="part3">Using the casual version of 「～て<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」</h2>
In casual speech, the 「～て<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 is often substituted by 「～ちゃう」 while 「～で<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 is substituted by 「じゃう」.  Both 「～ちゃう」 and 「～じゃう」
conjugate just like regular u-verbs.

<p>（１）　<span title="きんぎょ - goldfish" class="popup">金魚</span>が<span title="もう - already" class="popup">もう</span><span title="しぬ - to die" class="popup">死ん</span><em>じゃった</em>。- The goldfish died already.
<br />（２）　<span title="もう - already" class="popup">もう</span><span title="かえる - to go home" class="popup">帰っ<em>ちゃって</em></span><span title="いい - good" class="popup">いい</span>？- Is it OK if I went home already?
<br />（３）　<span title="みんな - everybody" class="popup">みんな</span>、<span title="どっか - somewhere (from どこか)" class="popup">どっか</span><span title="いく - to go" class="popup">行っ<em>ちゃった</em></span>よ。- Everybody went off somewhere.
<br />（４）　<span title="そろそろ - gradually" class="popup">そろそろ</span><span title="おそい - late" class="popup">遅くなっ<em>ちゃう</em></span>よ。- It'll gradually become late, you know.
</p>

<p>
There is yet another very colloquial version of 「～て<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 and 「～で<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 where it is replaced by 「～ちまう」 and 「～じまう」 respectively. Unlike, the cuter
「～ちゃう」 and 「～じゃう」 slang, this version conjures a image of rough and course middle-aged man.
<br />（１）　<span title="また - again" class="popup">また</span><span title="ちこく - tardiness" class="popup">遅刻</span><em><span title="する - to do" class="popup">しちまった</span></em>よ。- Darn, I'm late again.
<br />（２）　<span title="ごめん - sorry" class="popup">ごめん</span>、<span title="つい - unconsciously" class="popup">つい</span><span title="おまえ - you (vulgar)" class="popup">お前</span>を<span title="よぶ - to call" class="popup">呼ん<em>じまった</em></span>。- Sorry, I just ended up calling you unconsciously.
</p>

<h2 id="part4">Another meaning of 「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」</h2>
If you look up 「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」, the edict dictionary will say:
<br /><span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">仕舞う</span> 【<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>】 (v5u) (uk) to finish; to close; to do something completely; to put away; to put an end to;
<br />You may want to consider this a totally separate verb from the 「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 we have covered so far.  Occasionally but not usually,
「<span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまう</span>」 will have this meaning rather than the unintended action.

<p>（１）　<span title="しゅくだい - homework" class="popup">宿題</span>を<span title="やる - to do" class="popup">やって</span><span title="しまう - to do something by accident, to finish completely" class="popup">しまいなさい</span>。- Finish your homework completely.
